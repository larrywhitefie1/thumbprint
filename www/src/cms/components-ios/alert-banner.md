## ***Usage***

*`AlertBanner`* is only integrated as a global banner in the pro app that displays at the top of the application, between the status bar area and the navigation bar. This is the only intended usage for the component, so you should not need to instantiate the class directly.

To define a new global banner, see ContextualInsightView.php in website.
