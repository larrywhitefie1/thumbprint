Used sparingly, [Thumbprint icons](/icons/) provide increased meaning and visual importance to sections of content and user actions. Our published set consists of about 100 custom-drawn icons divided into nine categories, with a back catalog of another 400 that can be added as needed.

## Sizes

Each icon comes in at least two sizes, "medium" and "small", with a smaller number in a "tiny" size, and each is available for React, HTML, Android, PNGs for iOS, and the SVG itself.

| Size   | Dimensions | Example                        |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Medium | 28x28      | <ContentActionsAttachMedium /> |
| Small  | 18x18      | <ContentActionsAttachSmall />  |
| Tiny   | 14x14      | <ContentActionsAttachTiny />   |

<Alert type="warning" title="Donâ€™t resize icons">
    Although SVGs are resolution independent these icons were pixel-aligned to be rendered only at
    the dimensions provided. If you have a special case please contact the Design Systems team.
