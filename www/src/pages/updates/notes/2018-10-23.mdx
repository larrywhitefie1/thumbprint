## üç≠ Design

## üíæ API

-   **Aspect ratios:** As part of the Image Toolkit we've added Atomic classes and pattern documentation to support aspect ratios.
-   **Performance improvements:** We're working with the Growth team to test performance changes to the Instant Results page. This includes converting code to use Thumbprint Atomic as well as inlining CSS in the `<head>` tag.
-   **Contributions:** Thanks to Mark M. and Dan C. for [fixing a bug in Tooltip](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint-archive/issues/1033) and [adding `onKeyDown`](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint-archive/pull/1320) to the `Input` component.
-   **Behind the scenes infrastructure:** All Thumbprint examples are now using `README.mdx` files. [Learn more about the change](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint-archive/issues/1251).
