The Design System team is now one year old so instead of our usual update we thought we'd do a Year In Review. Thank you to all the Thumbtack teams who collaborated with us to make all this possible.

## 🚀 Brand relaunch

Our most visible work was managing the migration for our brand relaunch on May 1. It involved thousands of changes to icons, colors, and type and the cooperation of many across Thumbtack.

## 🧰 Toolkits

We designed and built all our planned Toolkits for year, including design assets, education sessions, and code components. Among them:

-   Cards
-   Avatars
-   Buttons
-   Grid & breakpoints
-   Global nav
-   Tooltips
-   Aspect ratios
-   Modals
-   Spacers
-   Global footer
-   Carousels

## 📖 Thumbprint documentation

We launched [thumbprint.design](https://thumbprint.design) to house all of our components with live examples, usage guidelines, and powerful search.

## 🔅 Icon migration & infrastructure

In addition to migrating all old icons we created the build system to support them on all of our platforms.

## 📱 Thumbprint Native

2019 will broaden our focus to our native apps. We're off to a good start with foundational toolkits — colors, icons, grid and type — already underway.

## 📦 Migration to Figma

Sketch served us well but it was time to move on. Lead by Jon K, we rebuilt all our components in Figma and led sessions to get everyone up to speed.

## ⚛️ Atomic CSS

We built, tested, and released an atomic CSS library to both speed up development time and decrease need for custom CSS.

## 🧟 Primo

It is dead. Let us never speak of it again.
