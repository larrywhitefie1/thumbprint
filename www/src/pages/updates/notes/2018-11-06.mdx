## üç≠ Design

-   **Figma Brownbags:** Newly freed from jury duty, Jon K. is now leading a number of sessions on Figma.
-   **Thumbprint Native:** Spacers are now complete, including better usage documentation, and the team is researching future component architecture along with ways to contribute.

## üíæ API

-   **Atomic migration:** The work to replace all deprecated Thumbprint Utility classes in `website` with Atomic equivalents is complete. This will ease the removal of legacy code and help with performance efforts. Thank you to all those who helped with the code reviews.
-   **Performance improvements:** Tom G. is using a Careers page conversion to React to test a smaller CSS payload and lazy-loaded responsive image components.
-   **Thumbprint Native:** Daniel O. has started investigating how to publish Thumbprint Tokens to iOS and Android.
-   **Open-sourcing Thumbprint:** Daniel O. sent out an RFC about open-sourcing Thumbprint. He has been working with Legal and doing needed infrastructure work to make it possible.
-   **Contributions:** Thanks to Rich P. for adding an `autoComplete` prop to `Input`, Bianca G. for adding `name` to `Select`, and Philipp C. for adding support for non-square images to `Avatar`.
