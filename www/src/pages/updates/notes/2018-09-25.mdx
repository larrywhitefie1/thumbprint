## üç≠ Design

-   **Color changes:** The color palette now contains new 100-level colors. Small changes were made to the 600 colors.
-   **Figma:** The Design Systems team continues to help with the migration to Figma.
-   **Native:** We've started talking with the native app teams to determine how we can best help them. Jon K. will lead the design efforts there.

## üíæ API

-   **Carousel:** The bulk of the Carousel component work has been completed and is in final code review. Thanks to Mark M. for all of the help in building it.
-   **Performance:** Tom G. and Richard W. are exploring performance optimizations that Design Systems can help with. Explorations include decreasing font sizes, moving to Atomic, and removing unused code.
-   **Image toolkit:** As part of the performance work, we're planning to introduce components that lazy load optimally sized images based on viewport and device.
-   **Deprecated `tp-spacer`:** The `tp-spacer` Sass function was deprecated on Sept. 11 in favor of margin and padding [classes from Thumbprint Atomic](https://thumbprint.design/atomic/) or [tokens from Thumbprint Tokens](https://thumbprint.design/tokens/#section-space).
-   **`atomicClass` prop:** Daniel O. and Tom G. met with a few front-end engineers to brainstorm improvements to the `atomicClass` prop. You can [contribute to the discussion](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint-archive/issues/1120) on GitHub.
-   **Bug fixes:** We've made a large dent in our backlog, [closing 19 bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint-archive/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+updated%3A%3E%3D2018-09-11) in the past two weeks.
-   **Infrastructure upgrades:** We've updated the versions of Thumbprint dependencies including Jest, Enzyme, Gatsby, and the Thumbtack ESLint config.
-   **Thumbprint Atomic migration:** We've started the process of replacing Thumbprint Utilities with the new Atomic class equivalents in `website`. Background classes are complete and we are planning to wrap up this project by the end of October.
