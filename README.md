# Thumbprint

[Thumbprint](https://thumbprint.design/) is a collection of UI components, icons, and design tokens for use in Thumbtack projects. Though its primary purpose to support Thumbtack projects, we have open-sourced it for those interested in how we build and manage our documentation and code.

## Technology

We have leaned on a variety of tools to build and maintain Thumbprint. Among those currently in use...

-   React and Sass for components.
-   [Design tokens](https://thumbprint.design/tokens/) for UI consistency.
-   Custom [functional CSS](https://www.mikecr.it/ramblings/functional-css/) library called [Atomic](https://thumbprint.design/atomic/) for layout.
-   [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) for managing the packages
-   [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for snapshot testing
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for publishing.
-   [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with [mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) for our documentation.
